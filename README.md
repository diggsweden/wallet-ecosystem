# Digg Wallet Local Development Environment

Docker compose scripts for starting Digg Wallet environment services locally.

---

## The Docker Compose Script

Before running the local environment, it is necessary to pull all images:

> docker compose pull (to ensure you are using the latest images)

It is also necessary to set the environment variable `HOST_IP` to the host's IP address inside a docker container.
This can be done by running the following shell command:

> source set-host.sh

**Note:** It is necessary to run this with `source` in order to retain the environment variable outside the context of the script.

After this, the local environment can be started by:

> docker compose up

## Building Images

If you need to add a new application to the Docker compose script its image need to be published.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are needed for running the scrips:

### Hosts File

- Edit your computer's hosts-file to contain mappings from `127.0.0.1`
  to local services at `*.wallet.local`

```
#
# Host Database
#
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost

# Digg Wallet Ecosystem
#
127.0.0.1       custom-verifier.wallet.local
127.0.0.1       refimpl-verifier.wallet.local
127.0.0.1       refimpl-verifier-backend.wallet.local
127.0.0.1       wallet-provider.wallet.local
127.0.0.1       pid-issuer.wallet.local
127.0.0.1       keycloak.wallet.local
127.0.0.1       traefik.wallet.local
```

### Certificate for TLS

### Install mkcert

#### Debian/Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt install libnss3-tools mkcert
mkcert --install
```

#### macOS

```sh
brew install mkcert
brew install nss  # Required for Firefox
```

### Trust mkcert CA root cert

Install the local CA in the system trust store:

```sh
mkcert -install
```

Note: The local issuer CA cert can be found with `cat "$(mkcert -CAROOT)/rootCA.pem"`

### Create Self-Signed Dev Certificate

Generate a certificate and key pair:

```sh
source set-host.sh
mkdir -p config/traefik/certs
mkcert --cert-file ./config/traefik/certs/wallet-cert.pem --key-file ./config/traefik/certs/wallet-key.pem "*.wallet.local" localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```
