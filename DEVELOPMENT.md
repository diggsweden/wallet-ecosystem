## Setup and Configuration

### IDE Setup

Run the code quality script.

```shell
./development/code_quality.sh
```

This will run the automated test suite
and other automation such as linters and formatters.
As a side effect all required dependencies will be downloaded.
After running the script, please take a look in
[the generated IDE configuration file](./megalinter-reports/IDE-config.txt).
It contains a list of suggested plugins and configuration for various editors and IDEs,
e.g. VS Code and IntelliJ.

#### VSCode

 1. Install plugins:

    - [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)
    - [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
    - [ShellCheck](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=timonwong.shellcheck)
    - [shell-format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foxundermoon.shell-format) version 7.2.5

        **Note 1:** There is
        [a known issue](https://github.com/foxundermoon/vs-shell-format/issues/396)
        with version 7.2.8 of shell-format
        preventing it from being detected as a formatter for shell scripts.
        Please use version 7.2.5 until the issue is fixed.

        **Note 2:** You need to have the `shfmt` binary installed in order to use the plugin.
        On Ubuntu you can install it with `sudo apt-get install shfmt`.

 2. Open workspace settings - settings.json (for example with Ctrl+Shift+P â†’ Preferences: Workspace Settings (JSON)) and add:

    ```json
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "shellformat.path": "<path to shfmt>",
    "[markdown]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint"
    },
    ```

## Development Workflow
